# Loan Approval Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
Loan Approval Prediction Dataset from Kaggle.

## Workflow
- Data cleaning and formatting
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values and categorical encoding
- Addressing class imbalance using SMOTE
- Training Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models
- Evaluation using Precision, Recall, and F1-score

## Key Insights
- Higher loan amounts tend to have lower approval rates
- Applicant income strongly affects approval probability
- Dataset is highly imbalanced

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Imbalanced-learn
